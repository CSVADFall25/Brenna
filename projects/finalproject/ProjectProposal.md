## Final Project Proposal

### Brenna Scholte and Ally Chu

Project Description and Inspiration: 

The Generative Scrapbook Studio is an interactive digital collage-making environment built with p5.js that modernizes the look and feel of physical scrapbooking. Users can upload personal photos and transform them into scrapbook-style elements using automated cut-out shapes, layered paper textures, stickers, and draggable/rotatable/resizable components. The tool integrates the OpenAI API, allowing users to generate custom transparent-PNG stickers, decorative backgrounds, and optional embellishments using natural-language prompts. The interface focuses on maintaining a sense of handmade craft, giving users expressive flexibility rather than confining them to rigid presets.

The final system should feel playful, easy-to-use, allow for one to craft creative digital art. A successful result is a fully functioning canvas where users can upload, generate, arrange, and export a unique scrapbook composition that retains a handmade aesthetic despite computational assistance behind the scenes.

Project Goals: 
- Set up the p5.js project and initialize the scrapbooking canvas.
- Add an image upload button and display uploaded photos on the canvas.
- Implement dragging, rotating, and resizing for image elements.
- Add textures, png shapes, and sticker-style visual effects. Potentially allow the use the built-in p5.js image filters.
- Connect the OpenAI Image Generation API.
- Create a prompt input UI for generating stickers or backgrounds.
- Allow users to arrange all elements into a final scrapbook composition.
- Add an export button to save the final scrapbook as a PNG or JPEG.
- If time allows:
  - Add generated color pallette based on the top colors from the uploaded images
  - Add hand-drawn brushes
  - Allow users to add text overlayed on images
  - Add gallery where users can view past scrabooking creations
  - Add layer controls (ex: bring forward/back, delete, duplicate)
